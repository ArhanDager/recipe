A French omelette starts out with beaten eggs in the pan (just like scrambled eggs). The pan is shaken constantly during cooking until the eggs just begin to set. When the eggs are cooked, the omelette is rolled and snugly folded to form an oval and finally turned out onto a plate with the seam side down.
